>Why do we need databases ?

  *If data and server is in the same system and system breaks we lose access to data (.csv files in your computer)
  *That is why we need DataBases
	 

>TYPES

   >Relational  (PostgreSQL, SQLite, MySQL)

	*Needs a predefined structure (info in different relational tables)
	*SQL as query language

   >NonRelational (MongoDB,

	*No predefined structure needed (all info in one document)
	*Use when: Data requirements are not clear, massive amount of unstructured data
