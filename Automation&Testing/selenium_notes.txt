>if you are getting a pop op on the seleniumeasydemo or other site
	try this approach

	chrome_browser.implicitly_wait(1)  # to avoid "not interactable" (basically button not being clicked error, this happens because selenium is so fast
	tries to click before the site is downloaded)

	popup = chrome_browser.find_element_by_id('at-cv-lightbox-close')
	popup.click()
